# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
  The main focus of this project was to refactor the code for the Horiseon Social Solutions website for better accessibility. Semantic tags for html and alternate attributes for images were added in order to increase the accessibility of the web page. The links in the navigation bar were also altered to take users to the correct portion of the page. The title was changed to be more concise and descriptive as well as optimizing the position in search engines. 

## Usage
Click the links on the navigation bar at the top to easily find the corresponding section on the page. Each section provides helpful tips from Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Useful for anyone looking to better manage their own business by taking advantage of search engines as well as social media to grow their visibility while reducing advertising costs.
